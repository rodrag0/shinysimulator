# shinysimulator
I was in a shiny hunt for the first time in my life and was wondering what my odds really were like so decided to program a console simulator. I suppose it does not only apply to pokemon but if you want to calculate what are the odds of something to happen in a sequence and get the average in multiple simulations.


#use
first insert how many times you want the simulation to be repeated to average.

then enter what are the odds for the event to happen, in case of pokemon, a shiny has the odds of 1/4096 to appear. so then in the program i enter 4096 as my odds.

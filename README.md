# shinysimulator
I was in a shiny hunt for the first time in my life and was wondering what my odds really were like so decided to program a console simulator. I suppose it does not only apply to pokemon but if you want to calculate what are the odds of something to happen in a sequence and get the average in multiple simulations.
